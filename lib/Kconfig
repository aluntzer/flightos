menu "Core Components"

config SYSCTL
	bool "sysctl interface"
	default y
	help
	  Enable use of the sysctl interface.

config MM
	bool "Memory Management"
	default y
	help
	  Enable use of the memory block management system. See the
	  platform-specific settings menu for configuration options.
	  Please note that the choices you make can have significant impact on
	  the memory footprint of the tracker, since each minimum block unit
	  requires one bit to track its usage status. For example, with an
	  upper block order of 32 and a lower block order of 12, i.e. a memory
	  size of 4 GiB and a page size of 4 kiB requires bit map space of
	  1 MiB.
