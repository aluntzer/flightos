menu "SPARC Configuration"

### Arch specific settings

config PAGE_OFFSET
	bool "Use an offset in physical/virtual page address conversion"
	default n
	help
	  Use a fixed offset when computing the virtual and physical page
	  addresses.

config EXTRA_SPARC_PHYS_BANKS
	int "Number of extra physical memory banks"
	default 0
	range 0 31
	help
	 Set number of additional physical memory banks if the machine has more
	 than one.

menu "Memory Management Settings"
	depends on MM

config SPARC_MM_BLOCK_ORDER_MAX
	int "Initial memory block order upper limit"
	depends on MM
	default 26
	range 6 32
	help
	  The upper limit order (i.e. 2^N bytes) of the largest trackable memory
	  block. If unsure, set this to the size order of your largest single
	  memory bank.
	  Allowed order range is 6 to 31.

config SPARC_MM_BLOCK_ORDER_MIN
	int "Initial memory block order lower limit"
	depends on MM
	default 12
	range 5 30
	help
	  The lower limit order (i.e. 2^N bytes) of the smallest trackable
	  memory block. If unsure, choose the page size of the platform.
	  Allowed order range is 5 to 30.

config SPARC_INIT_PAGE_MAP_MAX_ENTRIES
	int "Maximum number of mappings in initial page map"
	depends on MM
	default 8
	range EXTRA_SPARC_PHYS_BANKS 32
	help
	  Configures the storage space for the initial page map. It's wise to
	  say at least EXTRA_SPARC_PHYS_BANKS here.
