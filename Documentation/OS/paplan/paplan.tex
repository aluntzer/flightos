\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of the Document}


This document describes the \gls{SQA} activities that will be
performed in the development of the the operating system kernel LeanOS.
The document is applicable for all versions of LeanOS and and shall be updated
as needed.\\

\noindent
LeanOS targets the \gls{SSDP}, and to a lesser extent, its
compatible predecessor, the \gls{MPPB} v2.x \cite{MPPB}.
It is intended to be used in unmanned space applications of at least
Software Criticality Level C. \\

\noindent
This document follows the document structure for software product assurance
plans found in Annex B of ECSS-Q-ST-80C \cite{ECSS80C}.

\chapter{System Overview}

In the course of the \gls{NGAPP} activities, an evaluation of the \gls{MPPB}
was performed in a joint effort of \gls{RSA} and the Department of Astrophysics
of the \gls{UVIE}. While the original intent of the work of \gls{UVIE} was to
quantify the performance of the \gls{Xentium} \glspl{DSP} and the \gls{MPPB} as a
whole with regard to on-board data treatment and reduction in an astronomical
mission setting, it was found that, given the highly innovative nature of this new
processing platform, a novel approach was needed concerning the management of
system resources, \gls{DMA} mechanics and \gls{DSP} program design for best
efficiency and turnover rates. Consequently, \gls{UVIE} developed an experimental
operating system to stably drive the \gls{DSP} cores and the \gls{MPPB} close
to its performance limit. LeanOS is a development based on this operating system
concept.\\

\noindent
Further details on LeanOS may be found in \cite{ssdpOS}.

\section{Organization}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{images/software_dev_structure}
	\caption{A typical organisational structure in a software development
		 group.}
	\label{fig:sw_dev_org}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The \gls{SQA} organisation (\fig{fig:sw_dev_org}) for the development of LeanOS
is commensurate to the scope and size of the working group dedicated to
\gls{FSW} Development at the Department of Astrophysics of the University of
Vienna.\\

\noindent
As projects are typically carried out by a small group of people, several of
the project tasks may be executed by one and the same person.\\

\noindent
There is no formal \gls{PA} section at the Department of Astrophysics.
Instead, the \gls{PAM}, together with the other team leaders, forms a \gls{PA}
group for the specific project. In particular, the \gls{PAM} also takes over the
role of the \gls{SQAM} and nominates people as \gls{SQ} personnel as needed
and if applicable.\\

\noindent
\gls{PAM} and (internal) \gls{SQ} personnel maintain a level of independence
from the project and the software development.



\section{Responsibilities}

Formal responsibilities of the \gls{PAM} and \gls{SQ} personnel include process
and product assessments:

\begin{itemize}
	\item System and System Design Reviews
	\item Requirements Management
	\item Test Management
	\item \gls{NCR} Manangement
	\item \gls{SPR} Manangement
	\item Document Reviews and Review Packages
	\item Software Development Records
	\item Software Configuration Management
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Given the organisational and personnel constraints described in the previous
sections, activities of the \gls{SQ} personnel shall be conducted in an informal
way between the members. The \gls{PAM} shall assess and give assistance as to
the formal aspects of the product and process assurance. Examples of this
are configuration management or the state of completeness of review packages.\\

\noindent
The \gls{PAM} ensures the compliance with the software development processes
described in the corresponding software development plan if applicable.\\

\noindent
The main responsibilities of \gls{SQA} shall remain with the project team, in
particular the relevant software developer. In particular, this concerns
the documentation of any findings from software related activities, e.g. bug
tracking and repeated software testing during the development cycle.



\section{Resources}

Staffing to support software assurance activities must be balanced against the
other activities that are to be carried out within the project at any given time
period and against underlying availability of personnel.

The required resource levels shall be discussed, adjusted and managed in
conjunction with project management to ensure maintainance of adequate support
within the life cycle of the project.


\section{Reporting}

Since the project is not concerned with external partners, reporting done
informal informally, rather than via \glspl{SPAMR}.\\

\noindent
Still, these informal reports shall cover:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{SSS} coverage
	\item \gls{SRS} coverage
	\item \gls{SDD} coverage
	\item Testing activities
	\item Verification activities
	\item \gls{NCR} and action status
	\item \gls{SPR} and action status
	\item Product metrics
	\item Compliance and adherance to design and coding standards
	\item Methods and tooling
\end{itemize}

\noindent
No minutes of meeting or other record has to be made of meetings regarding
these informal reports.


\section{Quality models}

In ECSS-Q-ST-80C\cite{ECSS80C}, these potential quality characteristics of a
software application are identified:

\begin{itemize}
	\item functionality
	\item reliability
	\item maintainability
	\item reusability
	\item suitability for safety
	\item security
	\item usability
	\item efficiency
	\item portability
	\item software development effectiveness
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Functionality is explicitly covered in the \gls{SRS}\cite{leanosSRS}. Similarly,
the \gls{SRS} also covers maintainability, safety and security requirements, as
well as efficiency.

\noindent
Reliability is covered implicitly through the requirements formulated in the
\gls{TP}\cite{leanosTP} and \gls{TS}\cite{leanosTS}. which are designed to
to demonstrate the ability of the software to satisfy its requirements within
its operational domain.\\

\noindent
Usability is not formally relevant for LeanOS, but rather implied by software
design and its intended application.\\

\noindent
Portability and reusability are implicity by the type of software product
(an embedded operating system).\\

\noindent
Software development effectiveness is not covered explicitly, but is implicitly
covered by the definition of the development process.


\section{Risk Management}

If software-specific risks are identified during development, they shall be
incorporated into a risk portfolio by the \gls{PAM}. The status of corrective
and/or preventive actions shall be tracked, including a a general action plan
and progress per identified risk.

Given the small group of involved personnel, communication is straightforward
and ensures an efficient flow of information on an informal level.


\section{Supplier selection and control}

\emph{Not applicable.}


\section{Methods and tools}

The following tools are used for the management process:

\begin{description}[labelwidth=4em,leftmargin=\parindent,labelindent=\parindent]
	\item[\textbf{git}]		source code and document version control
	\item[\textbf{TeX Live}]	document preparation
\end{description}


\noindent
The following tools are used for the software development and testing process:

\begin{description}[labelwidth=4em,leftmargin=\parindent,labelindent=\parindent]
	\item[\textbf{sparc-gcc}]	C language compiler for \gls{SPARC}
	\item[\textbf{xentium-clang}]	C language compiler for the \gls{Xentium}
	\item[\textbf{gcov}]		code coverage testing
	\item[\textbf{doxygen}]		in-line software and \gls{API} documentation
\end{description}

\noindent
All of the listed tools are well established and are at a high level of maturity.


\section{Process assessment and improvement}

Assessment and possible improvement of the development process shall be done 
internally on an informal basis.


\section{Operations and maintenance}

No special quality measures are defined for operations or maintenance.



\chapter{Software process assurance}


\section{Software development cycle}

The software development life cycle will be defined in the \gls{SDP}


\section{Project plans}

A test plan is given in \cite{leanosTP}. The \gls{SDP} will be written.


\section{Software dependability and safety}

LeanOS is intended to be used is intended to be used in unmanned space
applications of at least Software Criticality Level C. However, \gls{FDIR}
analyses and derived measures, as well as the particular configuration of
the operating system to be used is highly dependent on the use case and must
be defined at a different stage. Fundamental dependability on a software
component level is ensured by verification and validation testing as part of the
software development process.
